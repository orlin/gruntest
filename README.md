# gruntest -- grunt test tests [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/orlin/gruntest.png)](http://travis-ci.org/orlin/gruntest)


## What

This will be a [grunt](http://gruntjs.com) plugin extracted from a `cake` task
that I don't want to keep copying all over the place, from one `Cakefile` to
another...

I like to use different test frameworks depending on what's being tested.
It's nice to have flexibility and some extra options about how tests are run.
It also helps to forget what frameworks, if any, are being used.
